An \textbf{Ornithopter} is a bio-inspired aircraft that achieves flight by imitating the flapping-wing motion of birds, bats, or insects. Unlike conventional planes or rotorcraft, which rely on fixed wings or rotating blades, an ornithopter generates both lift and propulsion through the rhythmic movement of its wings. This design allows for highly efficient and agile flight, making it a promising technology for applications in areas such as robotics, drone technology, and environmental monitoring. Advances in materials science and control systems have led to modern ornithopters that can hover, maneuver in tight spaces, and operate with greater precision than ever before.
