\chapter{Testing and Initial Results}

\section{Description of Testing Conducted}
The initial testing focused on the flapping mechanism of the ornithopter prototype. The prototype was tested without flight to evaluate whether the flapping frequency met the design requirements. The motor was powered, and the flapping motion was observed across various motor speeds.

\section{Preliminary Results and Observations}
The test results showed that the flapping mechanism produced between 7 to 12 flaps per second, while the design target was 5 flaps per second. This higher-than-expected flapping frequency is encouraging, as it suggests that the system can be fine-tuned to meet the specific requirements. The mechanical components of the flapping system operated smoothly, indicating that the current design is functioning as expected.

\section{Adjustments Based on Testing Outcomes}
Based on the test outcomes, the next steps will involve adjusting the motor speed and gearbox settings to regulate the flapping frequency to the desired 5 flaps per second. While the current performance exceeds expectations, fine-tuning will help optimize the mechanism for actual flight conditions. No major redesigns are necessary.
